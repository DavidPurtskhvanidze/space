<p>iLister allows administrator of the website to modify the listing packages that were assigned to the listings at creation time and are embedded in the listings. These are not the same as membership plan packages, these are copies of the membership plan packaged bound (applied) to particular listings. For more information on listing package please see the <a href="membership_plans.htm">corresponding subsection</a> of this manual. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This edit listing package functionality allows to modify the listing package in the listings directly. All changes to the listing packages are applicable almost immediately (please see <a href="managing_membership_plans.htm#listingpackagesynchronization">synchronization of packages</a> for more explanation when changes are applied) to the listings. However, this changes are not applicable to users' contracts or membership plan packages. In order to change membership plan packages or user contract please use the <a href="membership_plans.htm">corresponding page</a> of the Admin Panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The listing package editing functionality can be accessed via the "Manage Listings" page of the Admin Panel. To open this page first select the listings that you would like to change packages of, then press the "Edit Packages" option in the "Actions with selected" menu.</p>
<p><a href="select-listings-for-edit-packages.png"><img id="TOGGLE0186A1" class="image-toggle" src="select-listings-for-edit-packages.zoom75.png" border="0" alt="select-listings-for-edit-packages.zoom75"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will open a new page with a form similar to "Edit Package" form, but slightly different:</p>
<p><img src="edit-listing-packages.png" width="956" height="1057" border="0" alt="edit-listing-packages"></p>
<p>When administrator clicks on the "Save" button those fields that has been filled in will substitute the corresponding field values in the listing packages of the selected listings. Those fields that were left blank on the form will not change the corresponding values in the listing packages. Thus, for Boolean-type fields (True/False or Yes/No) this form uses a three-value control: disable option, enable option, and leave setting intact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The changes made to the listings packages will be in effect only until the listing expires. After expiration listing will fall back to the original listing package values as they are set in user's subscription plan. Please refer to <a href="managing_membership_plans.htm#listingpackagesynchronization">explanation</a> given in the "Edit Packages" section of this manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When editing listing packages this way <span style="font-weight: bold;">please be careful</span>. Using this feature can lead to a confusion either by website user or by administrator. This feature allows to create packages that are unique and very different from their's base packages. Thus many user would come up with a pretty natural question "Why..?". (e.g.: "Why I was able to upload 10 pictures per listings before and now I can upload only 4?")</p>
