<hr size="6">

<a name="SEC22"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="#TOC22">Refund/ Return/ Exchange Policy</a> </h3>
<p>By purchasing or using the Software, you acknowledge that you have exercised due diligence in ascertaining that the Software shall run on your intended hosting environment. It is your responsibility to ascertain and receive all required assurances from your hosting service provider that your hosting service provider offers all required extensions, configurations, and capabilities to fully support the Software's operation in its default configuration. The Owner may, but is not required to, provide assistance in fine-tuning, configuring, or otherwise altering your hosting environment. Further, the Owner shall not be liable for any costs, payments, charges, or fees borne by you or any third party to ensure that your hosting environment is compatible with the Software. At no time shall the inability to run the Software on any particular server environment for any reasons whatsoever be considered as the grounds, or reason for, a refund for, and/or return of, the Software.
</p>
<p>You further acknowledge that the Software's functions and capabilities meet your specific business requirements, needs, and expectations. You acknowledge and ascertain that you have reviewed the Software's operation on the demo and/or trial websites based on the Software, and made use of free demo installation on your and/or the Owner's server if required to test the software. Any additional functions, addons, modules, or customizations of the default functionality, can be purchased separately.
</p>
<p>The Owner provides refunds/returns/exchanges strictly based on the version of the terms of sale for each of the software editions active on the moment of purchase. For editions that contain no refund/return/exchange options in the terms of sale, all sales are final. Executing a forced refund, or charge back of funds by the End User in violation of the refund/return/exchange policy is considered an act of payment fraud and an unlawful breach of EULA. Such breach shall be prosecuted to the maximum extent allowable by law, both civil and criminal, and the Owner shall make every legal to recover all costs, expenses, and payments, which include, but are not limited to, any legal fees required to reverse the unlawful transaction and recover the payment.
</p>
<p>For the editions of Software that contain a refund/return/exchange provision in the terms of sale, and/or in the Software package, the User has the right to request a refund/return/exchange within the timeframe specified in, and in strict accordance with, the Terms of Sale, and/or this EULA. To claim the refund/return/exchange, the User agrees to provide a written statement detailing the reason(s) of the refund/return/exchange requested. Prior to executing a refund/return/exchange, the Owner may offer the User to resolve the issue(s) that have caused the User to request the refund/return/exchange, or may issue the refund. In the latter case, banking and/or processing fees for the transaction shall apply and shall be deducted from the amount to be refunded.
</p>
<p>The Owner may also issue a refund/return to the User as the Owner's initiative. In the event such a refund/return is issued, your License is terminated and you agree to destroy all copies of the Software and all installations of the Software (see Termination below).
</p>
<hr size="6">

<a name="SEC23"></a>
<h3 class="subsection"> <a href="#TOC23">Delivery and Distribution Policy</a> </h3>
<p>The Software is distributed in one of the following ways:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Email attachment</b>. In this case, all of the Software's files will be packed into an electronic archive and attached to the electronic mail message sent to the electronic mail address designated by the User. The Software is considered delivered at the moment when the message containing the Software archive has left the Owner's mail server.
	</li>
	<li><b>Downloadable package</b>. In regards to a downloadable package, the Owner provides the User with a link to a location containing the electronic archive with the Software. The Software is considered delivered when such link is provided to the User.
	</li>
	<li><b>Installation</b>. In case of installation, the User agrees to provide the Owner with all information and temporary access rights required for the Owner to successfully and completely install the Software on User's server. The Software is considered delivered once the installation is successfully completed. The User shall ensure full compatibility of the hosting environment with the Software requirements prior to the installation.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>You may choose any of the above delivery options and notify the Owner of your preferred delivery option, if any. All delivery options are available after the payment for the Software is approved by the Owner. The Owner shall make every reasonable effort to ensure uninterrupted access to the Software packages for the Owner's customers, and shall use other means of delivery, should you have difficulties with any particular delivery option listed above. In case of inability to deliver the Software to you for any technical reason or otherwise, the Owner shall make every effort to refund the transaction.
</p>
<hr size="6">

<a name="SEC24"></a>
<h2 class="section"> <a href="#TOC24">Force Majeure</a> </h2>
<p>Any of the parties hereto is not liable for failure to perform obligations arising out of the End User License Agreement in the event such failure is a result of Acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, storm, hurricane or other natural disaster), war, invasion, act of foreign enemies, hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared), civil war, rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power or confiscation, terrorist activities, nationalization, government sanction, blockage, embargo, labor dispute, strike, lockout or interruption or failure of electricity, telephone or Internet service. Failure to perform obligations under the EULA arising out of Force Majeure circumstances cannot be used as a reason for termination of the Agreement based on the Termination clause hereof below.
</p>
<p>In the event that any Party hereto uses Force Majeure as a reason for failure to perform the Party's obligation, then the nonperforming Party must prove that the nonperforming Party took reasonable steps to minimize delay or damages caused by foreseeable events, that the Party substantially fulfilled all non-excused obligations, and that the other Party was timely notified of the likelihood or actual occurrence of a Force Majeure event.

<hr size="6">

<a name="SEC25"></a>
<h2 class="section"> <a href="#TOC25">Amendments</a> </h2>
<p>The Owner reserves the right to update the EULA from time to time for various purposes. Such purposes include, but are not limited to, legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. The updates may be either planned or special. A planned update is an update to the EULA, which is related to the changes in the Software configuration or composition, products or services associated with, or supplied with the Software, or changes in the terms or levels of service that are provided with the Software. Such planned update to EULA comes in effect at the same time when a software release, or release of updates, upgrades, and bug fixes containing such planned update, is announced on the Owner's website. A special update is an update to the EULA, which is not necessarily related to any particular software release, or release of any updates, upgrades, and bug fixes, and which comes in effect on a specific date communicated at a minimum via our website, http://www.worksforweb.com.
</p>
<p>Any updated version of the EULA shall be posted on our website(s), and shall also be included in the Software default package, or update package, or bug fix package of the release for which the update of the EULA is announced. Any previous copies of EULA shall be made available by the Owner on request. If you do not wish to accept the updated EULA, you should not apply the upgrade, update, or bug fix, or any part thereof, that include the planned updated EULA, or discontinue the use of the Software. If you continue to use the Software after applying any modifications that come with the updated EULA, your use of the Software shall be indicative of your acceptance of such updated EULA. You shall be bound by the new terms and conditions of the EULA.
</p>
<hr size="6">

<a name="SEC26"></a>
<h2 class="section"> <a href="#TOC26">Termination</a> </h2>
<p>You can terminate the Agreement at any time voluntarily by effectively ceasing to use the Software, deleting any and all copies of the Software, as well as installation thereof. Voluntary termination shall at no time constitute the grounds and/or the reason for refund of the amount paid for the Software, and/or any other amount(s) paid for services and/or other products. All refunds, returns, and exchanges, notwithstanding the reasons, are governed by the Refund / Return / Exchange Policy above, as well as the terms of sale.
</p>
<p>The Owner reserves the right to terminate your license if you fail to comply with any of the terms of this EULA and/or the terms of sale pertaining to your purchase. The Owner shall issue a written notice of non-compliance with EULA and shall deliver such written notice using the contact information collected when you place your order, or any other contact information at the Owner's possession. The written notice of non-compliance with EULA shall detail the nature of non-compliance, as well as provide instructions on remedying such non-compliance. Your failure to restore compliance with EULA within the reasonable time indicated in the notice of non-compliance shall serve as a probable cause for termination of the license. The Owner shall furnish a license termination notice, upon the receipt of which you shall cease to use the Software, and shall destroy any and all copies of the Software and the installation thereof.
